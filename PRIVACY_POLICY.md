This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Android application published on Google Play.

## Information We Handle

### 1. Phone Numbers and Messages You Enter

When you use the App, you can enter:

- A **phone number**
- An optional **message text**

This information is used **only on your device** to:

- Construct a WhatsApp deep link URL (e.g., `https://wa.me/{phone_number}?text={message}`)
- Open WhatsApp (or another supported app) via Android Intent so you can send a message

**We do NOT:**

- Collect phone numbers or messages on our own servers  
- Store phone numbers or messages on our servers (we do not operate any backend server)  
- Sell, rent, or share phone numbers or messages with third parties

All processing related to the phone number and message happens **locally on your device**, and then the data is passed directly to WhatsApp (or another messaging app) when you tap send.

### 2. Other Personal Data

Aside from the phone number and message you explicitly type, the App:

- Does **NOT** require user registration or login  
- Does **NOT** collect your contacts  
- Does **NOT** collect location data  
- Does **NOT** collect device identifiers or analytics data  
- Does **NOT** use cookies or similar tracking technologies

## How We Use Information

Because we do not collect or store your data on our servers, our use of information is limited to:

- Building a deep link URL on your device using the phone number and optional message you provide  
- Launching WhatsApp (or another compatible app) using that URL so you can send a message

We do **not** use this information for analytics, advertising, profiling, or any other purpose.

---

## Data Storage

- All data processing (phone number and message) happens **locally** on your device.  
- We do **not** store this data on external servers.  
- We do **not** create any permanent database of your inputs.  
- Once you close the App or clear the fields, the phone number and message you entered are no longer available inside the App.

Any subsequent storage or logging of data is handled by WhatsApp or other messaging apps according to **their own** privacy policies.

---

## Third-Party Services

Quick Chat Message uses the official WhatsApp deep link mechanism (`https://wa.me/`) and Android intents to open WhatsApp (or other supported apps) on your device.

When you choose to send a message:

- The phone number and optional message you entered are passed to WhatsApp (or another messaging app) on your device.
- That data is then handled under **WhatsApp’s** or the respective app’s privacy policy, not ours.

We do **not** control how WhatsApp or other apps process your data.  
Please review WhatsApp’s and any other messaging app’s own privacy policy for more details on their data practices.

## Permissions

The App aims to be lightweight and privacy friendly:

- The App does **NOT** request sensitive runtime permissions like access to Contacts, SMS,
